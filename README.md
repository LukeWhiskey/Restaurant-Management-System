For Porgram to work, all 3 location links in Migrations.cs must be chnaged to the corresponding location of each MenuItems.CSV file on your local machine. Not doing this will cease program to function as intended.

Furthermore MySQL must be set up and The MySql Creation Script must be run to correctly generate the necassary tables.

One last thing. The password in the connection string within Migrations.cs and Tests.cs must be changed to an appropriate password you have used to set up MySQL, this is needed to access the Database. If you have set up the database with no Password, you must delete this field within the connection string.
